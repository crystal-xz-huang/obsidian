## 1.3 Arithmetic and Geometric Series

To analyse the time complexity of an algorithm, we often have to sum a large number of terms.

### Arithmetic Series

In an arithmetic series, the terms have a *common difference*. Gathering like terms gives:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + \dots + (a + (n-1)d) 
&= na + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} d \\
&= n \left[a + \frac{(n-1)}{2} d\right].
\end{align*}
$$
In a geometric series, the terms have a common ratio. Factorising gives

### Geometric Series

In a geometric series, the terms have a common ratio. Factorising gives:

$$
a + ar + ar^2 + \dots + ar^{n-1}
= a \cdot \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}.
$$

In particular, if $|r| < 1$ then as the number of terms increases to infinity, the term $r^n$ approaches zero, so the sum converges:

$$
a + ar + ar^2 + \dots = \frac{a}{1-r}.
$$
