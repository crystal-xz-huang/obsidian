## Logarithms

The logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential.  
For $a, b > 0$ and $a \neq 1$, we say

$$n = \log_a b \quad \text{if and only if} \quad a^n = b.$$

Thus $\log_a b$ can be read as *“to what power do we raise $a$ in order to get $b$?”*

## Properties of logarithms

- $a^{\log_a b} = b$, from the definition of the logarithm.  
- $\log_a (bc) = \log_a b + \log_a c$, from the index law $a^m a^n = a^{m+n}$.  
- $\log_a (b^k) = k \log_a b$, from the index law $(a^n)^k = a^{nk}$.  

## Change of base rule

Our logarithms will be base 2 unless otherwise specified, but this often doesn’t matter because of the change of base rule.  

For $a, b, n > 0$ with $a, b \neq 1$, we have

$$\log_a n = \frac{\log_b n}{\log_b a}.$$

If $a$ and $b$ are constants and $n$ is a variable, then the denominator $\log_b a$ is a constant.  
Thus $\log_a n$ is just a constant factor times $\log_b n$.  

In complexity analysis, we can ignore constant factors, which makes logarithms of any base interchangeable. We can therefore simply write $\log n$, suppressing the base.

⚠️ Important: This only applies to 'bare' logarithms. Constant factors in **exponents** cannot be ignored! Just as $n^2$ and $n^3$ are not equivalent $2^{\log_2 n}$ and $2^{\log_3 n}$ are not equivalent either.

$$2^{\log_2 n} \neq 2^{\log_3 n}$$
