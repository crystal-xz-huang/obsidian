## Orderings 

### ⬇️ downward direction

#### (strictly) decreasing

<b>Decreasing</b> means strictly decreasing — every next element is **less than** the previous one.

$$ a_1 \gt a_2 \gt \cdots \gt a_n$$

$$ 10, 9, 8, 3,1$$

#### non-increasing, descending

<b>Non-increasing</b> allows _ties_ — each next element is **less than or equal to** the previous one.

$$ a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \cdots \geq a_n$$

$$ 10, 10, 8, 3,1$$

### ⬆️ upward direction

#### (strictly) increasing

<b>Increasing</b> means <b>strictly increasing</b> — every next element is **greater than** the previous one.

$$ a_1 \lt a_2 \lt \cdots \lt a_n$$

$$ 1, 2,4,6$$

#### non-decreasing, ascending

<b>Non-decreasing</b> allows _ties_ — each next element is **greater than or equal to** the previous one.
No element is less than the element before it.

$$ a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n$$

$$ 1, 1, 2, 2,4,6$$
