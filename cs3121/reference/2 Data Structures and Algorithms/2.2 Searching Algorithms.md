# Searching Algorithms

## 2.2.1 Linear Search

Given an array $A$, we can search for a value $x$ by comparing each element of $A$ to $x$.  

- With **early exit**, the best case runtime is $O(1)$.  
- The worst case runtime is $O(n)$.  

Without further assumptions about the array, it is impossible to avoid checking each element of $A$.  

Similar methods can be used to find the **maximum** or **minimum** value in an array of *comparable items*, i.e. items that can be compared to each other.

## 2.2.2 Binary Search

Given a **sorted array** $A$, we can search for a value $x$ by comparing the middle element of $A$ to $x$ and recursing on the appropriate side.  

This relies on the observation:  if $A[i] < x$, then for all $j < i$ we have $A[j] < x$ also.  

- The worst case runtime is $O(\log n)$.  
- After each step, the search space halves, which can only happen $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ times.  

Extensions of binary search will be discussed in the **Divide and Conquer** module.
