#### Default open in new tab

- By default, when I click on a file, it opens in the current tab. Instead, I would like to override this behaviour to open in a new tab instead.

#### Opening another note in Split View

- **⌘ + ⌥ + Click** (CMD + OPT + Click) or **Right-Click > Open to the right** 
- Opening a file/tab to the right creates a NEW pane, even if there is already 2 panes, meaning there are now 3 panes. 
- Instead, open file in the right pane if it exists (don't create new one)
