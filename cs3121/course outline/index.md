| CLO1 | Explain how standard design techniques are used to develop algorithms          |
| CLO2 | Solve problems by creatively applying algorithm design techniques              |
| CLO3 | Communicate algorithmic ideas at different levels of abstraction.              |
| CLO4 | Evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and justify their correctness            |
| CLO5 | Apply the LaTeX typesetting system to produce high-quality technical documents |

### Objectives

Students will learn a variety of algorithm design techniques (greedy, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, etc). This will include famous algorithms using these ideas in graph problems, string matching, etc, but more importantly how to apply these ideas to develop correct and efficient algorithms to solve new problems. Students will develop their abilities in problem solving and analysis of algorithms, as well as in written communication as they express and argue for their ideas.
