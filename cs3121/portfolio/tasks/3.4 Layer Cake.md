# Notes

Requirement:
For cake `i` to be stacked on top of cake `j`:
- `li ≤ lj`, and
- `wi ≤ wj`

Choose an order for the cakes where every valid stack appears as a subsequence. Make sure the ordering is described unambiguously, and prove a brief justification for why it works.

**Order:** 
First sort in decreasing order of lengths. Then sort in decreasing orders of of widths?
- this means for cakes of equal lengths, the cake with the **larger** width appears **earlier**
