# Dominoes

A Questionable Tiling 

Is it possible to tile an 8×8 board with dominoes (2×1 tiles, which can be placed either horizontally or vertically) so that no two dominoes form a 2×2 square?

**A solution can be found in Algorithmic Puzzles by Anany Levitin and Maria Levitin, Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 90.**
