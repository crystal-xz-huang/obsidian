## Decision Problems and Optimisation Problems

**Decision problems**

- Questions of the form: <u>“Given some input, is there an $x$ which …”</u>  
- Answer is “Yes” or “No”.

**Optimisation problems**

- Questions of the form: <u>“What is the smallest/largest $x$ for which …”</u>  
- Answer is an object, e.g., a set or a number.

An optimisation problem is typically harder than the corresponding decision problem, but we can sometimes use decision problems to help us solve optimisation problems.

## Example Problems

```base
filters:
  and:
    - file.hasTag("examples")
    - file.hasLink(this.file)
views:
  - type: table
    name: Decision and Optimisation Problems
```
