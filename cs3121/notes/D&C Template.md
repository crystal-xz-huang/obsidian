### Template

There are in general three steps that one can follow in order to solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer manner.

1. **Divide.** Divide the problem $S$ into a set of subproblems: $\{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n\}$ where $n \geq 2$, i.e. there are usually more than one subproblem.
2. **Conquer.** Solve each subproblem recursively. 
3. **Combine.** Combine the results of each subproblem.

### Divide and Conquer Questions
