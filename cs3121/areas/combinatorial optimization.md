# Combinatorial optimization

> Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem, given some constraints.


Optimization algorithms are a class of algorithms that are used to find the best possible solution to a given problem. The goal of an optimization algorithm is to find the optimal solution that minimizes or maximizes a given objective function

## Optimality vs Correctness

- **Correctness**: the algorithm always produces a _valid_ solution to the problem.
- **Optimality** (stronger): the algorithm always produces the _best_ possible solution among all valid solutions.
