# Tiling a Deficient Board with Trominoes

![[w7-seminar-sols.pdf#page=8&height=500]]

> [!problem]
> **The problem** 
> - Given a $n$ by $n$ board **missing one square** where $n$ is of form $2^k$ where $k >= 1$ (Basically, $n$ is a power of $2$ with minimum value as $2^1$). 
> -The missing square can be any of the board squares.
> - We are required to tile the board using trominoes. 
> - A tromino is an L-shaped tile, formed by three adjacent squares.
> 
> **Constraints**
> 1. Tiling two trominoes may not overlap.
> 2. Trominoes should not cover missing square
> 3. Trominoes should cover all other squares.

- A triomino is an L-shaped tile in a 2×2 block with one cell of size 1×1 missing, 
- So the number of trominoes used becomes $\frac{2^{2k}-1}{3}$.

**When $k=0$** it has no defective square and number of trominoes is $0$.  
**When $k=1$**, there are exactly three non defective squares and these squares are covered using a triomino as shown already.

The problem can be solved by a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm that places a tromino at the center of the board in such a way that the problem’s instance of size n is reduced to four instances of the same problem, each of size $n − 1$. The algorithm stops after every 2 × 2 region with one missing square generated by it is covered with a single tromino.
