## Abstract

### Proof of Correctness for Binary Search

We must show that the algorithm *always* produces the correct answer:

- If `t` is in the array, the algorithm outputs “yes.”
- If `t` is not in the array, the algorithm outputs “no.”

At every stage, the algorithm maintains the following invariant:

At every stage, the algorithm maintains the following invariant:
