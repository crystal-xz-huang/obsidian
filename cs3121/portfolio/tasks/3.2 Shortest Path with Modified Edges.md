- The **length of a path** is the **sum of the weights** of the edges along that path.
- The **shortest path** from `s` to `t` is the path with **minimum total weight**.

## Question 1

We have a graph $G$ with positive edge weights and two designated vertices $s$ and $t$. 

Suppose we create a new graph $G^2$ which is the same as $G$ but with each edge weight squared. 

We note that, generally, for a graph $G$ that the shortest path from $s$ and $t$ in $G$ does not always go through the same vertices as the shortest path in $G^2$. 

Select the pair of vertices that serves as a counterexample:

> <b>“Show that the shortest path in $G$ is _not necessarily_ the same as the shortest path in path in $G^2$"</b>
> Select the pair of vertices that demonstrate this.”


## Question 2

We have a graph $G$ with positive edge weights and two designated vertices $s$ and $t$. 

Suppose we create a new graph $G_{\lambda}$, which is the same as $G$ but with each edge has an additional weight$\lambda$. Henceforth, suppose that $\lambda = 1$. 

As demonstration, here are sample graphs $G$ and $G_1$.
