Directed Graphs:
- In problems involving **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, it is often useful to impose a **topological ordering** and then think about the actual problem!

Time Analysis:
- Note that for graphs $G = (V , E)$, the input graph has size $|V | + |E |$. 
- So linear time in the input size means linear in $|V|+|E|$.
- A linear time algorithm is asymptotically “no slower than” reading the graph, so we can run these algorithms “for free”, i.e., without worsening the time complexity of our solution to any problem.
