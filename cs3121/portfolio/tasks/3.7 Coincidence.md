- Same as Interval Stabbing in Seminar 2



Given all the intervals sorted by their end points, what do we need to keep track of? The last stab point

- Since we always stab the next unstabbed end point, we can guarantee that there are no unstabbed intervals that are entirely before our last stab point. 
- For each interval we encounter (in ascending order of end point), that interval can start before/at or after our last stab point. 
	- If it starts before or at our last stab point, then it is already stabbed, so we ignore it and continue. 
	- If it starts after our last stab point, then it hasn’t been stabbed yet, so we should stab it and update the last stab point.


##### How do we decide where to stab?

We only need to consider the end points of the intervals as possible candidates for stabbing positions.

- Consider any solution where there is a stab not at the endpoint of an interval. Then we can create an equivalent solution by moving that stab rightwards until it hits an end point.
- Furthermore, combined with the fact that we must stab the first interval somewhere, we can say that we should always stab the first end point (the leftmost point at which any interval ends)

Suppose there is an optimal solution that does not include the first end point. Then the first stab point is either before or after that end point. If it is after, then it wouldn't include the interval with the first end point, and therefore wouldn't be a solution. So it must be before. Then, if the first stab point is before the first end point, then the solution including the first end point is also an optimal solution, as no other interval ends before then and therefore no intervals would not be skewered.
